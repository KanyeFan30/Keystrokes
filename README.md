# Keystrokes mod for Minecraft 1.8.9

> Display WASD, space, and LMB/RMB in a neat customisable HUD

**Changelog**

* **v1.0**: A barebones implementation which draws boxes and writes key names in them.

* **v1.1**: Improved the appearance by adding gaps between keys and an offset from the edge of the screen. The key layout was reorganized to follow convention.
